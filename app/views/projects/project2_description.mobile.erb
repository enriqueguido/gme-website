  GoWithMe was designed as a mobile application. Built on Ruby
  on Rails, the Eventbrite API lets the user find events and
  communicate through the application to find other users to
  go with to the event. Hosted on Heroku the application uses
  Postgres for its database and Facebook OAuth was utilized
  to facilitate a faster sign-up/sign-in process for the user.
  The frontend was created with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
  All design mock- ups and wireframes were created using
  Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.
